# Auto-Update Manual Test Matrix

Use this checklist for release-candidate updater artifacts. Run it against the
official channel and repeat the channel-selection checks for any supported fork.

## Pre-release smoke test

Before tagging a real version:

1. Build the app from the current branch: `npx tauri build`.
2. Temporarily set the version one patch behind in `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`, and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.
3. Re-build and install the older version. Quit.
4. Restore the real version. Build + publish the release with the updated workflow.
5. Launch the older version — within ~10 seconds you should see the banner.

## Per-platform checks

### macOS (Apple Silicon)
- [ ] DMG installer is signed + notarized (unchanged from previous flow)
- [ ] `.app.tar.gz` + `.app.tar.gz.sig` appear in the release assets
- [ ] `latest.json` is present in release assets
- [ ] Banner appears in popover on old version
- [ ] Tray icon shows red dot in top-right corner
- [ ] "Update Now" → download progress → app relaunches on new version
- [ ] "Skip" hides banner; next release re-triggers
- [ ] "Later" dismisses for this session only

### Windows 11
- [ ] NSIS `.exe` + `.nsis.zip` + `.sig` appear in release assets
- [ ] Banner + tray tooltip show on old version
- [ ] "Update Now" runs installer in passive mode and relaunches

### Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)
- [ ] `.deb`, `.AppImage`, `.AppImage.sig` appear in release assets
- [ ] Running via AppImage: full auto-update flow works
- [ ] Running via .deb: banner shows "Download" (not "Update Now") — opens GitHub release page in browser

## Failure-mode checks

### Update channel
- [ ] Official channel discovers and verifies the official release
- [ ] A compatible fork with releases can be selected and its public key is cached
- [ ] A fork without `updater-pubkey.txt` reports an actionable error and does not install

### Offline
- [ ] Disconnect network; launch app; no crash, no banner, Settings shows "Last checked: never" or preserved timestamp

### Rate-limited (403)
- [ ] Simulate by pointing `endpoints` at a non-existent 403-returning URL; scheduler should back off 12h → 24h (verify in logs at `~/Library/Logs/TokenMonitor/` on macOS)

### Corrupt signature
- [ ] Manually tamper with `latest.json` `signature` field; install should fail with red banner + error message

## Dev-mode note

The updater plugin does not fetch endpoints in debug builds by default. Verify by running `npx tauri build` and launching the bundled binary directly, not `npx tauri dev`.
